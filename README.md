To acces content postman will automatically use the created cookie. BUT you will need to add X-CSRFToken as a header, it is found in one of the cookies, just copy and insert, see image:

## Testing
 
### Python tests
 
To run tests, run the following command: coverage run manage.py test posts -v 2
 
Located in posts/tests.py and tests only functions in services.py.
 
#### Tests for add tags to post is located in: AddTagsToPostTest.
 
1. test_can_add_tags_to_post:
 
This tests that a post can have tags.

## Issues
Due to project requirements with website in separate domains the cookie cannot be shared and therefore it is a problem in Safari and mobile which does not allow cross-site tracking. It is however possible to turn it of in mobile, here is how you do it:

If the task did not require multiple projects I would have used an approach where I had put the website in the same domain with a proxy.

## Validator testing
 
### Python validation
All the python files pass validator testing pep8online without issues, except for the settings.py file in startsite which is auto-generated by django. This file gets 'E501 line too long' on AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS. I do not like to change this since it is auto-generated.
