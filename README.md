## Postman
Postmas is able to verify and use features directly against the api. It is included in the project.

To login use 'Login' rest availability in Postman. When used you will get a cookie, check the 'Cookies' section and verify:

To acces content postman will automatically use the created cookie. BUT you will need to add X-CSRFToken as a header, it is found in one of the cookies, just copy and insert, see image:

## Testing
 
### Python tests
 
To run tests, run the following command: coverage run manage.py test posts -v 2
 
Located in posts/tests.py and tests only functions in services.py.
 
#### Tests for adding tags to post is located in: AddTagsToPostTest.
 
1. test_can_add_tag_to_post:
 
When there are one tag submitted to a post,
It should be connected,
Then we should find the post by tag submitted.

2. test_when_no_tags_submitted_expect_no_tags_on_post:
When there are no tag submitted to a post,
It should not be connected to any tags,
Then we should not find any post for the tag.

3. test_when_two_tags_submitted_expect_match_on_both_tags:
When there are two tags submitted to a post,
It should be connected to both tags,
Then we should be able to find post by both tags.

## Issues

### Third-Party Cookies on different Web/Mobile Browsers
Due to project requirements with website in separate domains the cookie cannot be shared and therefore it is a problem in Safari and mobile which does not allow cross-site tracking. It is however possible to turn it of in mobile, here is how you do it:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92020968/198820423-ff5a080f-0b00-4e5f-ab5c-0fe6358f2e40.png)

If the task did not require multiple projects I would have used an approach where I had put the website in the same domain with a proxy.

### Admin web and website cookie
A known issue is that if a administrator log in to admin web and then visits website the cookie is not valid so the admin has to log out before using website.

## Validator testing
 
### Python validation
All the python files pass validator testing pep8online without issues, except for the settings.py file in startsite which is auto-generated by django. This file gets 'E501 line too long' on AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS. I do not like to change this since it is auto-generated.
